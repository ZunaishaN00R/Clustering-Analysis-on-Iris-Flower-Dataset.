# Clustering Analysis on Iris Flower Dataset.
Utilized the Iris flower dataset from sklearn, clustering flowers based on petal width/length. Omitted two features for simplicity. Explored preprocessing impact, considered scaling. Employed k-means algorithm, drawing an elbow plot to determine the optimal cluster count (k).

# Overview:
- Utilized the Iris flower dataset from sklearn.
- Focused on petal width and length, excluding other features for simplicity.
- Explored preprocessing, specifically scaling, to enhance clustering.
- Employed k-means clustering and evaluated the optimal k using the Elbow Method.

# Key Steps:
# Dataset Selection:
Employed the well-known Iris flower dataset.
# Feature Selection:
Focused on petal width and length, dropping other features.
# Preprocessing Consideration:
Explored the impact of scaling on clustering.
# Clustering Algorithm:
Utilized k-means clustering for flower segmentation.
# Elbow Method:
Plotted the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) against varying k values to determine the optimal number of clusters.

# Conclusion:
The analysis explores clustering on Iris flowers based on petal features. By assessing the Elbow Method, it identifies the optimal number of clusters, enhancing insights into flower groupings.
