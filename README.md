# Clustering-Analysis-on-Iris-Flower-Dataset.
Utilized the Iris flower dataset from sklearn, clustering flowers based on petal width/length. Omitted two features for simplicity. Explored preprocessing impact, considered scaling. Employed k-means algorithm, drawing an elbow plot to determine the optimal cluster count (k).
